# Lessons — the traps this project has already paid for

**This is the only list.** It used to be four: `CLAUDE.md`, and one in each of
`/decomp`, `/gameplay-port` and `/hang-investigation`. Six lessons appeared in
more than one of them, in five different wordings, and the copies had already
started losing clauses — the polymorphic-field trap is in all four lists and
only one of them still remembers `obj+0x1390`. Then a new lesson was written
into one list of four, which means three were wrong the moment it landed.

Every entry here cost this project real time. Each has a stable id so a commit
message, a session-log entry or a code comment can cite one — `L7` — instead of
restating it and starting the drift again. **Add new ones here and nowhere
else**; append, and do not renumber.

Read it before your first edit. The four groups below bite at different
moments: reading the binary, transcribing behaviour, running the tools, and
believing what you are looking at.

---

## Reading the binary

**L1 — The decompiler silently drops FPU arguments** to the matrix calls.
The pseudocode shows a call with fewer arguments than the instruction stream
passes, and nothing marks the omission. Re-read every constant with
`disassemble_bytes` and quote the raw hex in the annotation.

**L2 — `CamEvalObjectPath6` returns `{float x,y,z; int rx,ry,rz}`.** Ghidra
types all six as float. It is wrong, and the rotations come out as garbage
floats that look plausible enough to build on.

**L3 — Object fields are polymorphic.** `obj+0x11C` is hit points for combat
classes and a sub-type selector for others; `obj+0x1390` is a descriptor tail
for most classes and a parent actor pointer for one. **Check the class before
you name a field**, and name it for what that class uses it as.

**L4 — Match brace depth on the matrix stack.** `MatrixStackPush(0)`
duplicates the top, so parts come out siblings — unless a routine holds a push
open, which makes a real parent/child chain. Count pushes against pops.

**L5 — Two consecutive `MatrixTranslate` calls compose by addition**, not by
replacement.

**L6 — The adjacent-array trap.** Export and read only what the *index source*
names. Hunting for the end of a table finds the start of the next one, and the
result is a table with a plausible tail of wrong rows.

## Transcribing behaviour into the port

**L7 — Clocks belong to the port.** `action.t` was advanced by the renderer,
so a strike's hit frame could only arrive if something was drawing it, and a
restored save sat on a half-played swing for ever. `ActorAdvanceMotion` is in
`game/`.

**L8 — A clamp added for one state applies to all of them.** The inner-ring
stop that keeps actors out of the camera also made the lunge unable to reach an
attack whose own distance is *inside* that ring, so zombies swung for ever at a
range they could not close. Give the state its own floor.

**L9 — A permit held by an actor that cannot attack blocks everyone.** 161 of
stage 2's class-0x30 spawns have `attack_state <= 0`. Check before claiming,
and release on every path out; `ActorAbortAttackAndLeave` exists for that.

**L10 — `Math.random()` silently breaks the save state.** Two loads of one
snapshot diverge on the first swing, and nothing fails until someone notices
the game played out differently. Draw from `ctx.rng` or the `Rng` passed in.

**L11 — Do not move a test across a function boundary.**
`ZombieStateApproach` tests the queue rank *before* calling
`TryClaimAttackSlot`, and `ThrowerTryClaimAttackSlot` has no such test. Folding
the test into the claim is why the elevated throwers never threw.

**L12 — Two clocks, and they are not the same clock.** `Loop.advance` drains
the accumulator into **whole** frames and steps the walker once each;
`Player.gameTick` hands the game phase `frames: dt * 60`, which is fractional
and can be several frames at once. Establish which clock the thing you are
debugging is on before blaming it: an exact-frame cue is safe in the engine,
where `obj+0x19C` counts up by one, and is not automatically safe here.

## Running the tools

**L13 — A tool that prints nothing has not necessarily succeeded.**
`ghidra/run.sh` ran the headless analyzer under `set -e` and grepped the log
*afterwards*, so a run that died on the project lock — which is every run made
while the Ghidra GUI is open — printed nothing, exited 0, and left
`git diff ghidra/annotations` clean. That is indistinguishable from "there was
nothing to export", and a session's renames stay uncommitted while you believe
they are saved. **Check for the assertion, not for the absence of an error.**

**L14 — A check that asserted nothing is not a check that passed.** The
bundle-gated suites exit **3** for exactly this reason, and
`tools/verify_all.py` counts skips separately from passes. Four regression
tests were described in the record as passing while asserting nothing on any
machine without game assets.

**L15 — A green build is not a working page.**
`document.querySelector("#x") as T` is a lie the type system cannot catch: a
missing element is `null`, the cast hides it, and the first `addEventListener`
throws at startup behind a clean `tsc` *and* a clean `vite build`. That has
happened here — a shell `cd` failed, the markup edit never ran, and nothing
noticed. `verify_player_dom.py` is the guard; run it whenever you add a
control.

**L16 — A number written in prose is a second source for a fact a checker
already computes, and it will rot.** Hand-maintained counts in
`PLAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `PLAN.md` drifted by 5,716 lines, 17 divergences
and 412 named functions before anyone noticed. Countable facts live in
[`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md), which is generated; nothing else quotes them.

## Believing what you are looking at

**L17 — A negative result from one agent is not a fact.** Two agents reported
the sound ids unresolvable; a third found the table. "I could not find it" and
"it is not there" are different claims and only one of them needs evidence.

**L18 — Verify against the disc, not against another copy of your install.**
Four `cam/` files were rotted in the local extract, and a whole restoration
engine plus a documented "NaN padding convention" were built to explain the
damage before anyone compared against `hotd2.iso`.

**L19 — The screenshot is evidence and the render is not the game.** Stage 1's
block 4 renders perfectly and the enemies are simply outside the frame; stage
2's block 3 is a flat wall. Same fault class, and only one of them looks
broken.

**L20 — `[open]` is a useful answer and a guess is not.** Every claim about the
binary is marked `[proved]`, `[likely]` or `[open]`, and a thing is never named
for where it sits or what it resembles. This is the rule the other nineteen
lessons are downstream of.

**L21 -- Anything you copy has moved by the time you finish copying it.**
`web/src/hod2lib/` was written against `tools/hod2lib/` over one long session,
and a concurrent workstream committed a new character-type rule to
`spawnres.py` in the middle of it. The port reproduced the version that had
been read, exactly and wrongly: stage 2 came out with 291 placements against
the reference's 292, and nothing but the output comparison could have said so.
Re-diff the source against `HEAD` before you call a transcription finished --
`git diff <the commit you started from>..HEAD -- <the source>` -- and make the
check that compares the two outputs, not the two texts.

**L22 -- A trial parse must bound itself by its input, not by what its input
claims.** `container.classify` decides whether a blob is compressed by trying
to decompress it, and the LZ port preallocated its output from the file's own
u32 size header. 865 of the game's files have a first dword that merely looks
like a size, up to 4.03 GB of it in `tex/st5_01b.bin`. Node hands over a 4 GB
buffer and the decode then fails, so the CLI never noticed for a moment; a
browser refuses, and a `RangeError` is not the `LZError` the trial was catching,
so it escaped and killed the export at the first raw texture bank. The grammar
cannot exceed 78.8 bytes out per byte in, which makes that header refusable by
arithmetic rather than by attempt. **And: the same code on two runtimes is two
implementations.** Everything about this bug was present in the CLI, passing.

**L23 -- A filter that makes the output look better is a claim about the game,
and it needs the same evidence as any other.** 5.1% of this game's triangles
are collinear in UV space, which smears one row of texels across a whole face:
a hard streak, or a solid black panel. The exporter deleted them by default and
recorded that "why the game does not show them is still unresolved -- either
way they carry no displayable texture information, so dropping them can only
improve the result." It could not: two of stage 1's are paving in the piazza,
and the bundle had a pair of triangular holes straight through the world. The
premise was never checked against the binary, and when it finally was,
`WalkMeshChainAndDraw` turned out to make no per-triangle test of any kind --
the game draws every one of them. **An unresolved question in the docstring of
a filter that is on by default is a divergence nobody declared.** The check
that catches this class is one that compares the export against the files it
was made from; comparing two exports with each other cannot.

**L24 -- Two live copies of the same data means "I fixed it" is only ever true
of one of them.** The player reads a stage from the dev server's
`extract/player/` or from the browser's OPFS cache, whichever holds it, cache
first. An exporter fix was verified against the server copy, reported as done,
and the reader was still looking at the cache -- which had been built before
the fix and which no version check could tell was old, because the only checks
were the bundle format and a digest of the *declarations*, and the fix changed
neither. **A version stamp has to cover whatever decides the bytes**, which for
a bundle is the exporter's code and not its interfaces. And the stamp for
"stale" must warn where the stamp for "unreadable" refuses: refusing on an
exporter change makes every unrelated fix cost a full re-export before the page
will open at all, which is how a check gets deleted. The gap had been written
down as a known unfixed item one session earlier, which is worth less than
nothing if it is not the first thing consulted when a fix does not appear to
land.

**L25 -- A wrong picture passes a weak check three times in a row.** The
thumbnail a stage is built with is meant to be a frame some seconds in. Three
separate faults each produced a flat fill of the fog colour -- a transport the
loader had stopped, a capture taken off the frame callback, and a second
request landing during the next stage's teardown -- and every one of them left
the surrounding state looking healthy: the walker at its first wait, the region
streamed, four models visible, 222 draw calls and 2,880 triangles through the
renderer. The assertion written for it, "the picture is mostly not black", was
true of all three. **Counting distinct colours is what tells a photograph from
a wash**, and the only reason any of it was caught is that the image was
written to a file and looked at. When a check is about something visual, the
first version of it should be your own eyes on the artifact; the automated one
comes second, and has to be able to fail the thing you just saw.


**L26 -- A `[diverges]` note describes what somebody meant, and only a check
says what the code does.** `render/rigs.ts` carried a careful paragraph saying
that before the first shot selects a route the port "draws the exporter's baked
root pose", with the measurement showing that pose and the descriptor's agree
for every rig in the six stages. The code placed the fallback instance from its
`op_` path at frame 0 instead, which is a pose the object never holds: stage 3's
boat stood parked in the canal, a hundred units off the shot, for the whole
opening. The note was the *reason it was never looked at* -- it read as though
the case had been thought about and settled. A divergence declared in prose and
not pinned by an assertion is a claim with an alibi; the fix here was one line
of code and three new checks, and the checks are the half that will still be
true next year.

**L27 -- An on/off test the engine does not have is a divergence nobody
declared.** `SetFogRange` (`FUN_004ABDF0`) doubles its two arguments, swaps them
when `near*2 >= far*2`, and pushes them. That is the whole routine: there is no
"is fog enabled" anywhere in it. `render/fog.ts` had invented one -- `far >
near` -- and it was invisible because the *ordinary* case passes it. What it
broke was the two cases that look degenerate and are not: `near == far` is the
zero-width ramp every stage's fade to black is made of (40 sites), and `near >
far` is a real band drawn between `far*2` and `near*2` (stage 5, blocks 7 and
9). **A guard added because a value pair "looks wrong" is a claim about the
data**, and this one was wrong about 40 sites in the shipped scripts. Scan the
shipped data for the values the guard would reject before writing it.

**L28 -- A worktree agent has to check where a repo tool wrote.** Two
`annotate.py` calls were made with a `cd` to the shared checkout in front of
them, so the rows landed in the user's tree and not in the branch that cited
them. Nothing said so: `annotate.py` printed `added`, `verify_annotations`
passed against the file it had just written, and the mistake only surfaced when
`verify_port` failed on a citation whose TSV row "did not exist". The shared
tree then had two uncommitted rows in a file two workstreams write. Check the
diff in *your* tree after any tool that writes one, and check that the shared
one is unchanged.
