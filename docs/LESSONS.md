# Lessons — the traps this project has already paid for

**This is the only list.** It used to be four: `CLAUDE.md`, and one in each of
`/decomp`, `/gameplay-port` and `/hang-investigation`. Six lessons appeared in
more than one of them, in five different wordings, and the copies had already
started losing clauses — the polymorphic-field trap is in all four lists and
only one of them still remembers `obj+0x1390`. Then a new lesson was written
into one list of four, which means three were wrong the moment it landed.

Every entry here cost this project real time. Each has a stable id so a commit
message, a session-log entry or a code comment can cite one — `L7` — instead of
restating it and starting the drift again. **Add new ones here and nowhere
else**; append, and do not renumber.

Read it before your first edit. The four groups below bite at different
moments: reading the binary, transcribing behaviour, running the tools, and
believing what you are looking at.

---

## Reading the binary

**L1 — The decompiler silently drops FPU arguments** to the matrix calls.
The pseudocode shows a call with fewer arguments than the instruction stream
passes, and nothing marks the omission. Re-read every constant with
`disassemble_bytes` and quote the raw hex in the annotation.

**L2 — `CamEvalObjectPath6` returns `{float x,y,z; int rx,ry,rz}`.** Ghidra
types all six as float. It is wrong, and the rotations come out as garbage
floats that look plausible enough to build on.

**L3 — Object fields are polymorphic.** `obj+0x11C` is hit points for combat
classes and a sub-type selector for others; `obj+0x1390` is a descriptor tail
for most classes and a parent actor pointer for one. **Check the class before
you name a field**, and name it for what that class uses it as.

**L4 — Match brace depth on the matrix stack.** `MatrixStackPush(0)`
duplicates the top, so parts come out siblings — unless a routine holds a push
open, which makes a real parent/child chain. Count pushes against pops.

**L5 — Two consecutive `MatrixTranslate` calls compose by addition**, not by
replacement.

**L6 — The adjacent-array trap.** Export and read only what the *index source*
names. Hunting for the end of a table finds the start of the next one, and the
result is a table with a plausible tail of wrong rows.

## Transcribing behaviour into the port

**L7 — Clocks belong to the port.** `action.t` was advanced by the renderer,
so a strike's hit frame could only arrive if something was drawing it, and a
restored save sat on a half-played swing for ever. `ActorAdvanceMotion` is in
`game/`.

**L8 — A clamp added for one state applies to all of them.** The inner-ring
stop that keeps actors out of the camera also made the lunge unable to reach an
attack whose own distance is *inside* that ring, so zombies swung for ever at a
range they could not close. Give the state its own floor.

**L9 — A permit held by an actor that cannot attack blocks everyone.** 161 of
stage 2's class-0x30 spawns have `attack_state <= 0`. Check before claiming,
and release on every path out; `ActorAbortAttackAndLeave` exists for that.

**L10 — `Math.random()` silently breaks the save state.** Two loads of one
snapshot diverge on the first swing, and nothing fails until someone notices
the game played out differently. Draw from `ctx.rng` or the `Rng` passed in.

**L11 — Do not move a test across a function boundary.**
`ZombieStateApproach` tests the queue rank *before* calling
`TryClaimAttackSlot`, and `ThrowerTryClaimAttackSlot` has no such test. Folding
the test into the claim is why the elevated throwers never threw.

**L12 — Two clocks, and they are not the same clock.** `Loop.advance` drains
the accumulator into **whole** frames and steps the walker once each;
`Player.gameTick` hands the game phase `frames: dt * 60`, which is fractional
and can be several frames at once. Establish which clock the thing you are
debugging is on before blaming it: an exact-frame cue is safe in the engine,
where `obj+0x19C` counts up by one, and is not automatically safe here.

## Running the tools

**L13 — A tool that prints nothing has not necessarily succeeded.**
`ghidra/run.sh` ran the headless analyzer under `set -e` and grepped the log
*afterwards*, so a run that died on the project lock — which is every run made
while the Ghidra GUI is open — printed nothing, exited 0, and left
`git diff ghidra/annotations` clean. That is indistinguishable from "there was
nothing to export", and a session's renames stay uncommitted while you believe
they are saved. **Check for the assertion, not for the absence of an error.**

**L14 — A check that asserted nothing is not a check that passed.** The
bundle-gated suites exit **3** for exactly this reason, and
`tools/verify_all.py` counts skips separately from passes. Four regression
tests were described in the record as passing while asserting nothing on any
machine without game assets.

**L15 — A green build is not a working page.**
`document.querySelector("#x") as T` is a lie the type system cannot catch: a
missing element is `null`, the cast hides it, and the first `addEventListener`
throws at startup behind a clean `tsc` *and* a clean `vite build`. That has
happened here — a shell `cd` failed, the markup edit never ran, and nothing
noticed. `verify_player_dom.py` is the guard; run it whenever you add a
control.

**L16 — A number written in prose is a second source for a fact a checker
already computes, and it will rot.** Hand-maintained counts in
`PLAYER_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `PLAN.md` drifted by 5,716 lines, 17 divergences
and 412 named functions before anyone noticed. Countable facts live in
[`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md), which is generated; nothing else quotes them.

## Believing what you are looking at

**L17 — A negative result from one agent is not a fact.** Two agents reported
the sound ids unresolvable; a third found the table. "I could not find it" and
"it is not there" are different claims and only one of them needs evidence.

**L18 — Verify against the disc, not against another copy of your install.**
Four `cam/` files were rotted in the local extract, and a whole restoration
engine plus a documented "NaN padding convention" were built to explain the
damage before anyone compared against `hotd2.iso`.

**L19 — The screenshot is evidence and the render is not the game.** Stage 1's
block 4 renders perfectly and the enemies are simply outside the frame; stage
2's block 3 is a flat wall. Same fault class, and only one of them looks
broken.

**L20 — `[open]` is a useful answer and a guess is not.** Every claim about the
binary is marked `[proved]`, `[likely]` or `[open]`, and a thing is never named
for where it sits or what it resembles. This is the rule the other nineteen
lessons are downstream of.
