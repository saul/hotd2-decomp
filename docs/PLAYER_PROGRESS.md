# Browser stage player — progress

Running state of the web player. The plan and its rationale are in
[`PLAYER_PLAN.md`](PLAYER_PLAN.md); how to run it is in
[`../web/README.md`](../web/README.md). This file is the checklist and, more
usefully, the record of **what was got wrong and how it was caught** — the
player is a consumer of the RE, so it is where reading errors surface as
visible misbehaviour.

**Status:** R0–W5 shipped and working. W6 (visual regression) deferred, as
planned.

---

## Phases

| # | Deliverable | State |
|---|---|---|
| **R0** | Library refactor — `hod2lib/{stage,script,campaths,bundle}.py`, CLI tools reduced to argparse shells | ✅ glTF, `.bin`, region sidecars and `dump_stage_script` text all **byte-identical** across 6 stages × 2 game modes; `verify_*` all pass |
| **E1** | `tools/export_player.py`, `hod2lib/bundle.py`, cam + script serialisers | ✅ 12 stage bundles, 166 MB; `manifest.json` carries a `format` the client checks and the SHA-256 of every source file |
| **E2** | GLB packaging in `gltf.py` | ✅ one 24 MB `stage2.glb` replaces `.gltf` + `.bin` + 1241 PNGs |
| **W1** | Vite + TS + Three scaffold, bundle loader, static render, URL state | ✅ typechecks and builds clean; all state URL-addressable including `freeze=1` |
| **W2** | Hermite eval, rails, free-roam camera | ✅ curves evaluated client-side; rails per path with the active sub-range highlighted |
| **W3** | Script walker, region visibility, step mode | ✅ every op reachable and seekable; only the current region drawn |
| **W4** | Play mode, branching, enemy simulation | ✅ route graph walked; branch points pause with a seeded countdown; combat on a tunable per-enemy timer |
| **W5** | Audio, fog, route minimap, Arcade/Original toggle, event feed, inspector | ✅ BGM, SE and voice all play, dispatched by namespace; scene fog rendered radially |
| **W6** | Visual regression harness | deferred — `freeze=1` and the URL state it needs are already in place |

## What the player consumes, and what it exposed

The player turned out to be a good oracle for the RE. Five readings that
looked right on paper produced visibly wrong behaviour, and the binary settled
each one.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Most of a stage never ran; regions and camera barely changed | **A block's steps are sequential.** `end_block` advances to the next *step*; only an exhausted step table reaches the route table. Treating every `end_block` as a block exit ran one step per block | read `EvtAdvanceBlockOrRoute` |
| Scene ended early | Route **kind 2 is not "end"** — it falls through to `block + 1`. The scene ends when that block is a hole | same |
| Branch buttons picked the wrong route | A branch takes `next[branch_choice]`, not "a target"; `branch_choice` resets to 0 on every block change and every writer of it is gameplay code | same |
| Clicking a branch button did nothing | The countdown re-announced the branch every frame, so the UI rebuilt the buttons 60×/s and the click never landed between `pointerdown` and `pointerup` | notify on *change*, not on tick |
| Branch preview showed an unrelated shot | The `store_six` preview was carried across block changes. All four in stage 2 sit *inside* branch blocks | discard on block change, same lifetime as `branch_choice` |
| Whole view tilted down | `eye.y = path.y - 15` was applied **before** the look-at, but the game derives pitch and yaw from the *unshifted* `eye - target` and only then overwrites `eye.y` | translate after orienting |
| Camera still too low | The `-15` should not be applied at all — see below | reverted, with the measurement |
| Fog far too thick | `SetFogRange` **doubles** near and far before the device sees them, and three.js's fog factor is `smoothstep` where D3D's is a straight ramp | double the range, patch the fragment chunk |

## Findings the player produced

Things established while building it, now folded back into the format docs.

- **`store_six` (`0x60`) is the arcade branch preview.** `[proved]` — three
  `(frame, slot)` camera poses indexed by `branch_choice`, from reading the
  scatter in `EvtActionStoreSixOperands60` against the gather in
  `FUN_00403DB0`. Note the order: frame first. Recorded in
  [`formats/evt.md`](formats/evt.md).
- **`queue_event` sel `0x21` is a camera *state selector***, not "hand control
  back from a path", and `cam_play` with `flags & 2` **stashes rather than
  plays** — a later `0x21, 6|7` runs the stashed range. 208/208 follow that
  idiom.
- **The BGM tables.** `[proved]` — one sound id space split by the top nibble,
  two contiguous BGM filename tables whose lengths are fixed by their
  adjacency. Recorded in [`formats/sound.md`](formats/sound.md), and as a
  plate comment on `PlaySoundId` in the Ghidra database.
- **Four `cam/` files have individual bytes smashed to `0xFF`.** 120 destroy a
  float's exponent and decode to NaN or ~1e38; others hit a mantissa byte and
  decode to an ordinary-looking number no finiteness test can catch — `cp_st1`
  path 1's `target_y` holds `da 2c 40 41` = 12.011 seventeen times and
  `da 2c ff 41` = 31.897 three times. `st1evtbl` plays the affected paths, and
  the format reading is confirmed instruction by instruction through the
  loader, `CamBindPathSlots`, `CamEvalPath7` and `CamEvalHermiteCurve`, so the
  shipped executable evaluates them too. The files over-determine themselves —
  channels of a path share a time base, keys sharing a time are duplicates, and
  `st1evtbl`'s own `cam_play` extents state each path's duration — and
  `hod2lib.cam` restores **90 fields, 81 of them exactly**, recording the
  evidence for each. Stage 1's opening cameras now chain end to end (path 2
  ends at eye = (−37.88, 15.20, 133.74) and path 3 starts there) where before
  they jerked. See [`re/anomalies.md`](re/anomalies.md).
- **The skip feature is one assignment short of working.** `2C` is live,
  both player-update routines poll Start while the shutter's firing gate is
  down, and `40`/`41`/`42`/`2E` all test the skip flag — but the poll writes
  `DAT_009A1A18`, which nothing reads, and `DAT_009A2D74` is only ever written
  0. The player implements the machinery as written and supplies that one
  assignment from a Skip bar, which rises from the bottom of the rendered view
  under the game's own condition and so marks every moment a skip would have
  been accepted.
- **Fog is per-mesh, and its values were in the data all along.** TSP bit 23
  is `FOGENABLE` **inverted**, so fog is on when the bit is clear — which is
  what `ModelForceFogControlNone` exploits. 2197/2219 stage-2 materials are
  fogged. The client renders it **radially** (fog factor from true distance)
  rather than reproducing D3D's default view-space-Z falloff, which fogs the
  screen corners less than the centre; `planar` is a toggle for comparison.
- **The sound tables.** `[proved]` — one id space split by the top nibble, and
  all four name tables read out. Three of the four store no count and are
  bounded only by the table that follows them. `se_play` is **not** restricted
  to SE: across the six stage scripts its operand names 9 BGM tracks, 6 voice
  lines and a stop as well. [`formats/sound.md`](formats/sound.md).
- **Light and fog values are readable.** The `0x20`–`0x27` operands are
  pointers to float constants in the evt file; dereferencing them turns 1,888
  bytes of "unattributed residue" into real values — stage 2 block 3 opens with
  fog near 21, far 507, light RGB (1.0, 0.9, 0.77), ambient 0.5.

## Open, and what each costs

Ranked by what they would actually change on screen.

| Open | Effect | Where the work is |
|---|---|---|
| What starts a stage's own BGM | the player names the stage track by convention and says so | decomp — the scene-entry path, not an xref sweep over 496 callers |
| `path.y - 15` compensation | nothing today; the player is correct without it | decomp — what `0x009A60C0` is, and whether `g_camera_eye_y` is the final world eye |
| `0x40C790` | whether deferred (state 6/7) shots are yaw-only | decomp, small |
| Spawn class → model | enemies stay markers | decomp, large — the class table holds handler addresses |
| W6 harness | no regression safety net | client |

### Object rigs

`op_` paths move *things*, and those things are rigs assembled in code — 168
functions call `AssetDrawSlot` and there is no rig format to parse, so
`hod2lib.rigs` transcribes the draw routines by hand. Nine of the 31
`CamEvalObjectPath6` callers are done.

The player renders them, and adds the motion. Rig roots ship **unparented**,
tagged `hod2_path_slot`, because the bundle carries no baked animation — so
the client evaluates the `op_` curve itself. That is what lets it honour three
things exactly rather than approximately:

- **the frame clamp**, `min(frame, CAM_PATH_LENGTH[slot])` — the object stops
  at the end of its path instead of extrapolating along the last segment;
- **the position bias**, added *before* the pose rotations, which a child node
  cannot express (`T(p+b)·R` is not `T(p)·R·T(b)`);
- **the camera gate** — routines dispatch on `g_active_cam_path`, so an
  instance is present only while the camera is on a shot that selects it. The
  object and the shot run on one clock, which is the point.

Parts whose rotation is driven at runtime are **not** baked: `rigs.py` records
the rule, the bundle carries it, and the inspector shows it. Stage 1's vehicle
has nine such parts — wheels, occupants, a swing arm, and four trail effects
that cycle their model every frame.

`obj_484ff0_props` is transcribed but deliberately **not placed**: the variant
that selects which prop is drawn comes from a pointer that is not the spawn
descriptor, so there is nothing to place it against yet. The bundle carries
the reason and the player shows it rather than guessing.

## Which instructions the UI strikes through

The script tree and the event feed **strike through any instruction the player
does not act on**, and dot-underline the ones it approximates, so it is
obvious at a glance how much of a stage is really being honoured. The map
lives in `web/src/opstatus.ts` — in TypeScript rather than the bundle, because
it describes the *client*, and only the client knows what it has implemented.

Ranked by how often they occur across the six arcade stages, what is still
struck through:

| Op | Name | Uses | Worth doing? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `52`/`53`/`54`/`55`/`56`/`57` | `asset_*` file traffic | 2717 | No — the bundle already holds every model and texture |
| `31` | `goto_scene_state` | 274 | Only with a scene state machine |
| `28` | `region_load` | 262 | No — preloads what is already resident |
| `59`/`58`/`5A` | asset job drains | 188 | No — nothing is ever pending |
| `2C` | `set_skippable_region` | 126 | **Done** — drives the Skip bar; dead in the retail build only for a missing assignment |
| `33` | `set_action_drain_mode` | 125 | Only with the action ring |
| `10`/`11` | collision sets | 113 | Only with collision |
| `0A` | `spawn_simple` | 98 | Maybe — its descriptors are not resolved to markers |
| `49`/`4A`/`4B` | `variant_*` | — | **Worth checking** — a global picks which operand list runs, so some spawns may never appear |

With rain in, the remaining struck-through opcodes are all either moot in a
bundle that already holds every asset, dead in this build, or gated on
machinery the player does not have (a scene state machine, the action ring,
collision). The one genuine unknown left is `variant_*`.

## Deliberate non-goals

- **It is a script walker, not the event VM.** The blocking opcodes gate on
  live state that is still being decompiled. Everything the data determines is
  executed; everything else is *reported* in the feed with the condition it
  would have blocked on. A guess dressed as an interpreter would be worse than
  an honest walker.
- **Opcodes without a meaning show raw operands**, never an invented label.
- **Enemies are markers.** The class → model mapping is unsolved, so there is
  nothing to look a model up by.
- **The bundle is never committed.** It is game-derived data;
  `extract/player/` is gitignored, and BGM streams from the user's own install
  rather than being copied.

## Every opcode, and what the player does with it

> table against that one; it is what caught `enable_rain` being struck through

All 96 dispatch slots, generated against `hod2lib.evt.OPCODES` so none can be
missed. Meanings and confidence marks live in
[`formats/evt.md`](formats/evt.md); this table is only about the **client**.


- **done** — the client acts on it — you can see or hear the result
- ~approx~ — acted on, but by a rule the client can evaluate rather than the game's
- *tracked* — state is kept and shown in the HUD or inspector; nothing is drawn from it yet
- shown — decoded into the event feed with its operands; no state, no effect
- n/a — a proved no-op, a dead opcode, or a dispatch slot no shipped file encodes

### The eye-height note

`0x1A` and `0x36` are marked *tracked* rather than **done** on purpose. Every
camera hook applies `eye.y = use_fixed_y ? fixed_eye_y : path.y - 15`, but
applying that to the `cp_` curve puts 173 of 201 paths looking upward at their
own aim point, so the client records both values and applies neither. The
measurement and a switch to re-enable it are in `web/src/campath.ts`.
