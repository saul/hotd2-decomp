# Session log

Append-only record of work sessions. **Read the most recent entry first** — it
tells you exactly where the previous agent stopped and what to do next.

Conventions:

- Newest entry at the **bottom**.
- Every entry ends with an explicit **Next actions** list.
- Record what was *tried and failed* as well as what worked. Dead ends are
  expensive to rediscover.

## Session 1 — Phase 0 baseline

**Outcome:** repo bootstrapped, Phase 0 complete. Commit `647cbad`.

Established the asset inventory, the `pol/` container layout, the `tex/`
headerless texture-bank hypothesis, and that the renderer is Direct3D 7. Full
detail in [`../PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) and [`../formats/`](../formats/).

Key numbers recorded in `manifest.csv` / `inventory.csv`; key invariants in
[`../../tests/README.md`](../../tests/README.md).

## Session 2 — Phase 1 start: Ghidra environment

**Outcome:** Ghidra project created and auto-analysed. Baseline inventory
exported. Analysis proper has **not** started.

### Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Ghidra | 12.1.3 PUBLIC at `~/ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC` |
| Java | Temurin 25.0.4.1 |
| Project | `ghidra/project/HOTD2.gpr` (gitignored, 17 MB) |
| Driver | `ghidra/run.sh` (committed) |
| Scripts | `ghidra/scripts/` (committed) |
| Output | `ghidra/out/` (gitignored) |

Recreate the project from scratch at any time with:

```sh
./ghidra/run.sh import                        # ~2 min, runs auto-analysis
./ghidra/run.sh script ExportInventory.java   # regenerate the baseline
```

### Auto-analysis baseline

```
image base        : 0x00400000
language          : x86:LE:32:default
compiler spec     : windows
functions total   : 1891
  non-default name: 73
  thunks          : 17
bytes in functions: 417259
```

Memory blocks match the Phase 0 header parse exactly, which cross-validates both:

| Block | Range | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `Headers` | `00400000`–`00400fff` | 4096 |
| `.text` | `00401000`–`004c3fff` | 798720 |
| `.rdata` | `004c4000`–`00574fff` | 724992 |
| `.data` | `00575000`–`009cbfff` | 4550656 |
| `.rsrc` | `009cc000`–`009cdfff` | 8192 |
| `tdb` | `ffdff000`–`ffdfffff` | 4096 (Ghidra synthetic) |

### Two observations that matter

**1. Function coverage is only ~52%.** 417259 bytes of the 798720-byte `.text`
are inside recognised functions. The remaining ~380 KB is either unreached code,
data embedded in `.text`, or jump tables Ghidra did not resolve.

This is expected for an MSVC 6.0 binary with no symbols, but it is also a
**risk**: the decompressor could easily be sitting in the unanalysed 48%. Before
concluding a function does not exist, force disassembly over the gaps.

**2. Only 73 of 1891 functions have non-default names.** These come from
imported thunks. No CRT or library identification has happened yet, so
essentially the whole binary is still `FUN_xxxxxxxx`. Applying signatures is the
single highest-leverage next step.

### Ghidra MCP

The `ghidra-mcp` bridge is deployed and healthy at `http://127.0.0.1:8089`
(`/mcp/health` returns ok). It was **not usable** in this session: the agent had
no MCP tools registered, and the bridge speaks MCP to a registered client rather
than plain HTTP — every path except `/mcp/health` returns
`404 No context found for request`.

Registered it in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "ghidra": { "type": "remote", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8089/mcp", "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

Config is only read at startup, so this takes effect after an opencode restart.
The next session should have Ghidra MCP tools available for interactive queries.

**Note:** MCP is for interactive exploration. Anything that constitutes a
*result* should still be captured as a committed script in `ghidra/scripts/` or
as documentation, because MCP calls leave no reproducible trail.

### Dead ends — do not repeat

- **PyGhidra scripts do not work.** This Ghidra was not launched with PyGhidra,
  so `.py` GhidraScripts fail with `Python is not available`. `support/pyghidraRun`
  exists, but enabling it needs the `pyghidra` Python package. **Write Ghidra
  scripts in Java** (`.java` GhidraScript) — that always works, and
  `ExportInventory.java` is a working template to copy.
- **Raw HTTP against the MCP bridge does not work.** Only `/mcp/health` responds.
  Do not waste time probing paths; use a registered MCP client.

### Next actions

Nothing below has been started.

1. **Apply MSVC 6.0 signatures.** Ghidra's `Function ID` analyser with the
   `vs6` / MSVC signature sets. Expected to name a large fraction of the ~1891
   functions and remove the static CRT from consideration. Biggest single win
   available.
2. **Identify and tag the `d3du`/D3DX utility library.** Its diagnostic strings
   are present (`CD3duContext::Resize`, `CHelInfo::Initialize`, `_ChooseZBuffer`
   and others); walk their xrefs to name the owning functions, then tag the whole
   cluster as library noise. Stock DX7 SDK sample code, safe to excise.
3. **Force disassembly over the ~380 KB of uncovered `.text`** and re-export the
   inventory to see how much new code appears.
4. **Import DX7 SDK headers as a GDT** so COM vtable dispatch resolves.
5. **Seed the anchors** from [`addresses.md`](addresses.md) as named labels —
   the six asset loaders, the allocator at `0x4A7400`, the `.data` tables. Write
   this as a committed Java script (`SeedAnchors.java`) so it is idempotent and
   re-runnable after any re-import.
6. **Find the `pol/` loader** by following xrefs from the dir-template table at
   `0x57A008`. This is the entry point to the largest asset set and is still
   unknown.
7. **Resolve `0x4C4074`'s neighbour at `0x4C40A4`** — an imported function called
   on the path buffer immediately before every `CreateFileA`. Probably a path
   normaliser or a debug logger; naming it clarifies all six loaders at once.
8. **Then Phase 2:** trace each loader's `ReadFile` buffer to its consumer and
   triage the decompressor candidates listed in `addresses.md`.

### Files added this session

```
ghidra/run.sh                      reproducible headless driver
ghidra/scripts/ExportInventory.java  function/symbol inventory exporter
docs/re/session-log.md             this file
```

`.gitignore` was amended so `ghidra/scripts/` and `ghidra/run.sh` are tracked
while `ghidra/project/` and `ghidra/out/` are not.

## Session 3 — Phase 2 SOLVED: the compression codec

**Outcome:** the codec is broken, implemented and verified. Phase 2 is done.
This unblocks 793 of the ~1150 asset files.

### Ghidra MCP now works

After an opencode restart the MCP tools registered. The GUI had **no project
open**, so the sequence that actually works is:

```sh
~/ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC/ghidraRun ~/hotd2-decomp/ghidra/project/HOTD2.gpr &
# then, via MCP tools:
list_instances   ->  connect_instance("HOTD2")  ->  open_program("/Hod2.exe")
```

`list_instances` reporting `program_count: 0` and `open_programs: []` means the
GUI is up but idle — connect, then explicitly `open_program`.

### How the codec was found

Not by pattern matching. `get_xrefs_to(0x57A008)` — the `pol\%s` dir-template
table — pointed at `FUN_00418200`, and one decompile made it obvious:

```c
ReadFile(h, staging, size, &read, NULL);
size = *staging;                    /* u32 uncompressed size */
LzDecompress(staging + 1, dst);     /* +1 on a u32* skips the header */
```

Two call sites in that one function, `pol/` and `tex/`, identical shape. The
callee at `0x0040ACD0` is the decompressor.

**The Phase 1 candidate list was entirely wrong.** All fourteen sites were found
by searching for a 4 KB window mask (`& 0xFFF`). The real window is 8 KB and its
size never appears as a constant — the offset comes from sign-extending a 13-bit
field, so there is no mask to grep for.

> **Lesson, recorded because it generalises:** trace the data path from the
> loader. Do not hunt for algorithm-shaped constants.

The Unicorn harness planned in `tools/emu/` turned out to be **unnecessary** —
the decompiled function was directly readable. That directory is now unused;
keep it only if a future function resists static reading.

### The format

LZSS, 8192-byte window. Flag bits LSB-first, interleaved with payload bytes in
one stream. Long form: 13-bit offset + 3-bit length, with an extra length byte
when the field is 0; `u16 == 0` terminates. Short form: 2-bit length + 8-bit
offset. Offsets always negative; matches copied byte-at-a-time so overlapping
runs are intentional. Full spec in [`../formats/lz.md`](../formats/lz.md).

### Verification

```
793 compressed files (458 pol/ + 335 tex/), 0 failures
60,571,242 -> 131,562,208 bytes (2.17x)
18,027 models parsed from the decompressed containers
```

```sh
python3 tools/verify_lz.py --game-dir "/path/to/THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2"
```

### Two corrections to earlier work

**1. The container offset table is NOT a fixed `0x800`.** Entry 0 *is* the table
size. Decompressed containers carry right-sized tables — observed `0x20` upward,
always a multiple of 32. The Phase 0 spec generalised from the uncompressed
files, which happen to use `0x800`. `container.md` is corrected.

**2. Classifying by `dword0 > filesize` is unsafe.** Raw texture banks routinely
open with pixel data whose first dword exceeds the file size —
`tex/etc_boy_kao.bin` starts `0xA32992E8` and is entirely uncompressed. That
heuristic produced **24 false positives**. Classification is now trial-based in
`container.py`: valid container, then attempt decompression, then blob.

Corrected census:

```
pol/   458 compressed   192 raw     6 blob
tex/   335 compressed   87 blob    47 bmp    23 empty
```

### Anomalies resolved

The three same-size-but-different `pol_*` twins from Phase 0 are **confirmed
corrupt** — their unprefixed counterparts decompress cleanly, these do not.

Four files are exactly 987 bytes with distinct hashes (`bg_adv19.bin`,
`komono_0.bin`, `tv2.bin`, `tex/scr_tod_itm_itamidome2.bin`). All are referenced
by name in the exe. Probably cut content whose slots were filled with junk.
Low priority.

### Ghidra annotations (saved to the project)

| Address | Name |
|---|---|
| `0x0040ACD0` | `LzDecompress` + full format plate comment |
| `0x00418200` | `LoadCommonPolTexBanks` + plate comment |
| `0x004C40A4` | resolved as `OutputDebugStringA` — debug logging, not path processing |

Note the MCP rename tool enforces a PascalCase + known-verb convention and warns
on violations; `LzDecompress` trips the verb check harmlessly.

### Next actions

Phase 2 is closed. Phase 1 housekeeping is still **not** done and is now the
main blocker on understanding materials.

1. **Apply MSVC 6.0 Function ID signatures.** Still untouched. 2048 functions,
   almost all `FUN_*`. Biggest single win available.
2. **Identify and tag the `d3du`/D3DX library** via its diagnostic strings.
3. **Force disassembly over the uncovered `.text`** (~48% at last count) and
   re-export the inventory to see what appears.
4. **Resolve how the game picks raw vs compressed.** `LoadCommonPolTexBanks`
   decompresses unconditionally, yet 192 `pol/` files are raw. Check the other
   two `0x57A008` consumers at `0x0041887D` and `0x00418C80`, neither of which
   is currently inside a recognised function.
5. **Phase 3: write `nl1.py`.** The container parser already yields 18,027
   models; parsing them is the next deliverable and needs no new RE.
6. **Phase 4: textures.** Now unblocked for the compressed banks too, which
   should shrink the unreferenced-slot gap problem considerably.

## Session 4 — Phase 1 closed: signatures, library tagging, code recovery

**Outcome:** Phase 1 complete. Library noise identified and tagged, function
coverage raised from 52% to 70%.

### MSVC 6.0 signatures — already done, no action needed

Ghidra ships `vsOlder_x86.fidbf`, the Function ID database covering VS6, and the
Function ID analyser is **enabled by default**. It had already run during the
Session 2 auto-analysis.

Result is thin but real: ~35 genuine CRT functions (`__ftol` with 308 xrefs,
`_malloc`, `_memset`, `_strlen`, `_strcmp`, `__CxxThrowException@8`, the
`__local_unwind2` family), plus a large set of `Catch@`/`Unwind@` labels from the
PE exception-handling analyser.

Do not expect more from FID here. MSVC 6.0 coverage in `vsOlder_x86` is limited,
and there is no PDB. The remaining CRT is identifiable by *position* instead —
see the library map below.

### The d3du/D3DX library — 30 functions named exactly

The much bigger win. The DX7 SDK utility library is stock Microsoft sample code
compiled in, and its diagnostic strings carry literal `Class::Method - message`
text. That means the owning function can be named **exactly**, not guessed.

`ghidra/scripts/TagLibraryFunctions.java` does this: match the diagnostic
pattern over defined strings, walk xrefs to the containing function, vote on the
most frequent candidate name, rename, and tag `D3DX_LIB`.

70 strings matched, 30 functions named — `D3DXInitialize`, `d3dxCreateContext`,
`CD3duContext__Resize`, `CD3duContext___CreateZBuffer`, `_ChooseZBuffer`,
`CD3duGlobals__FindBestMatchForHWLevel` and so on. Full list in
`ghidra/out/d3dx_lib.txt`. Idempotent — re-running renames nothing already named.

### Library vs game code

The single most useful structural fact learned this session: **`.text` splits
cleanly.**

| Range | Contents |
|---|---|
| `0x00401000` – `~0x004AC000` | **game code** |
| `~0x004ACF50` – `0x004B74xx` | statically linked MSVC 6.0 CRT |
| `0x004B74FC` – `0x004BC063` | DX7 SDK `d3du`/D3DX library (tagged `D3DX_LIB`) |
| `0x004C31xx` – `0x004C3FFF` | CRT tail, exception unwind helpers |

Everything from roughly `0x004ACF50` upward is library. Filter `D3DX_LIB` and
ignore that range when hunting game logic. This is consistent with
`LzDecompress` at `0x0040ACD0` and every asset loader sitting well below the
boundary.

### Code recovery — 52% to 70%

Auto-analysis left ~380 KB of `.text` outside any function.
`ghidra/scripts/RecoverCodeGaps.java` recovers it, deliberately conservatively.

Inspecting a gap showed what was actually wrong: the bytes at `0x004023C6` are
**already disassembled** — a `CALL`/`JMP` stub pair followed by a state machine
on a global. Real game code that Ghidra never wrapped in a function. The gap
report flags this as `has_orphaned_instructions`.

The fix exploits an MSVC convention visible in that dump: **runs of `NOP`/`int3`
padding delimit functions.** So a gap qualifies if, after skipping padding, it
either starts with a known MSVC prologue *or* is already disassembled and sat
behind padding.

Run repeatedly — each pass exposes new gaps as bodies form:

```sh
HOTD2_APPLY=1 ./ghidra/run.sh script RecoverCodeGaps.java   # repeat until 0
./ghidra/run.sh script ExportInventory.java
```

| Metric | Session 2 | Now |
|---|---|---|
| functions | 1891 | **2278** |
| bytes in functions | 417,259 | **557,972** |
| `.text` coverage | 52.2% | **69.9%** |
| non-default names | 73 | 105 |

### The remaining 30%

240,789 bytes still uncovered across 1859 ranges. Composition: ~26 KB already
disassembled but orphaned, ~27 KB defined data, ~12 KB padding — so roughly
175 KB is undisassembled bytes.

Recovery converges asymptotically (one function per pass at the end), so the
easy wins are taken. The residue is most likely **flow-truncation damage**: a
callee wrongly marked non-returning cuts its caller short, leaving the tail
orphaned. Ghidra's `clear_flow_and_repair` addresses exactly this, but its own
documentation warns it can clear healthy code and is not idempotent. **Do not
run it broadly** — apply per-function, verify, and only where a specific
function is visibly truncated.

This is not blocking. Every function needed so far — the loaders, the
decompressor — is fully formed.

### Gotchas

- **Script execution over MCP is disabled** (`GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS` unset),
  so scripts must be run headless via `./ghidra/run.sh`.
- **Headless cannot open a project the GUI holds.** Save via MCP, `pkill -f
  ghidra.GhidraRun`, run the scripts, then relaunch. Batch headless work rather
  than alternating.
- `createFunction` returning null is normal in damaged regions; the script
  reports the first ten failures rather than swallowing them.

### Next actions

Phase 1 and Phase 2 are both closed. The critical path is now Phase 3/4.

1. **Phase 3: `nl1.py`.** The container parser already yields 18,027 models.
   Parsing them needs no new RE and is the shortest path to visible geometry.
   Spec is written; mind the four known reference-implementation bugs.
2. **Phase 4: textures.** Now unblocked for compressed banks too, which should
   shrink the unreferenced-slot gap problem substantially.
3. **Map the `.data` filename/count tables** (`0x4D1410`, `0x4D1B00`,
   `0x4D1BC8`, and neighbours). Phase 4 needs the per-bank texture counts.
4. **Import DX7 SDK headers as a GDT** before Phase 5 materials work, so COM
   vtable dispatch resolves.
5. Optional: resolve how the game picks raw vs compressed — the other two
   `0x57A008` consumers at `0x0041887D` and `0x00418C80`.

## Session 5 — Phase 3/4: levels, textures and glTF export

**Outcome:** whole stages export to glTF with correct textures and verify in
Blender. Phases 3 and 4 are functionally complete.

### NL1 parser

`tools/hod2lib/nl1.py`, written from the spec with the four known
reference-implementation bugs fixed. Validated across the corpus:

```
327 files, 9,112 models, 1,488,301 vertices, 1,317,805 triangles
no structural problems (indices in range, all positions/UVs finite)
```

That run also closed several open questions outright — the game uses a much
narrower slice of the hardware than NL1 allows:

| | |
|---|---|
| shading modes | lambert and constant only — **no bump, no vertex colour** |
| pixel formats | RGB565, ARGB4444, ARGB1555 — **no palettised, no YUV422** |
| mipmaps | **none** |
| list types | opaque and translucent — **no punch-through** |

So the packed-s8-normal byte-order question is moot (vertex-colour meshes never
occur), the 56-byte bump vertex path is never exercised, and there are no
palettes to find.

### Textures — the hard part

The Phase 0 hypothesis (concatenated in ID order, offsets = prefix sum of
computed sizes) was **wrong**, and wrong in a way that looked right: 115 banks
summed exactly. Decoding an actual image is what exposed it — `st2_01` texture 0
was a clean gradient, texture 1 was pure noise.

Two independent bugs, both invisible without looking at pixels:

1. **Sizes are padded to 2048-byte boundaries.** 64×64 VQ needs 3072 bytes and
   occupies 4096. Sizes already on a 2048 boundary are unpadded, so a prefix sum
   works for some banks and silently drifts in others.
2. **For VQ, the TSP size field is half the real dimensions.** It describes the
   index array; each index covers a 2×2 block.

The tell: **all 115 exactly-summing banks were non-VQ; every VQ bank was wrong.**

#### What actually solved it

Reading the game's own code, not more statistics. `FUN_00418E40` sets
`DAT_00960720 = *(u32 *)(0x0055B9B8 + bank_index * 4)`, and `FUN_004AC980`
indexes it as `table + texture_id * 16`.

**Texture metadata is compiled into `Hod2.exe`, not stored in `tex/` at all.**
16-byte descriptors: width, height, pixel format, PVR layout code, bank offset,
global slot id. `exetab.py` extracts them straight from the PE.

Result: **303/303 banks resolve exactly** — mean coverage 1.000, zero overflow.

> I burned a lot of this session on statistical proxies (adjacent-pixel
> coherence, brute-forced base offsets, SmallVQ hypotheses) that were all
> inconclusive or actively misleading — one metric scored flat black regions as
> perfect. The Phase 2 lesson applied here too and I was slow to reach for it:
> **trace the data path in the binary.** Reach for the decompiler first when a
> layout question resists two quick experiments.

### Export

`tools/hod2lib/gltf.py` writes glTF 2.0 + `.bin` + PNGs, with raw PowerVR2 state
preserved in `material.extras.pvr2` so a target engine can be exact rather than
relying on the approximate PBR mapping.

Stages span many `pol/` files, so `--stage N` merges them into **one** glTF with
a parent node per segment. Texture IDs are per-bank — tex 0 of `st2_01` is
unrelated to tex 0 of `st2_02` — so everything keyed by texture is keyed by
`(part, texture_id)` and PNGs go in per-part subfolders. Getting this wrong
silently cross-wires textures between segments.

Segments are already positioned in **world space**: stage 2 spans x ±3384 with
no per-segment transform needed.

```
stage2: 18 segments, 141,802 verts, 97,799 tris, 1811 materials, 947 textures
Blender: 51 mesh objects, 0 broken images, 0 objects without UVs -> CHECK-OK
```

`tools/blender_check.py` runs Blender headless to verify an export and render a
preview. Worth keeping — it caught the texture bug immediately and is much
faster than opening the GUI.

### Still to verify visually

- **Twiddle transpose.** Morton A (y even, x odd) is implemented. For square
  textures the alternative is an exact transpose, and my symmetric coherence
  metric cannot distinguish them by construction. Decoded images look correct,
  but a definitive check needs a texture with legible text or a known logo.
- **UV V orientation.** Written as stored; Blender's importer flips it, matching
  the reference addon. UV ranges well outside [0,1] are normal here — the game
  relies on REPEAT wrapping.

### Next actions

1. **`coli/` collision.** Structure is partly visible: a 216-byte repeating
   record `[tag][count=52][52 floats]` containing unit normals and plane
   distances, but the leading records do not fit that stride. Needs the hit-test
   routine RE'd rather than guessed — `FUN_0048A310` is the loader.
2. **`evt/` and `cam/` for segment streaming.** Stage segments exist as separate
   `pol/` files and are almost certainly loaded on demand; the event tables and
   camera paths should say when. This is the missing piece for reconstructing a
   playable level rather than a static dump.
3. **DX7 SDK headers as a GDT** before Phase 5 materials work.
4. Trailing bytes in banks where the descriptor table stops short of the file.

## Session 6 — face winding fix

**Reported:** exported levels showed back-faces almost everywhere.

**Confirmed and fixed.** Corpus-wide agreement went from **3.4% → 97.81%**.

### Diagnosis

NL1 stores per-vertex normals, which makes winding objectively testable rather
than a matter of taste: compare the geometric normal `(b-a) x (c-a)` against the
summed vertex normals and count sign agreement.

First measurement, before any change:

```
agree     3.4%
disagree 96.6%

by culling flag:
  cull=1  agree 84.7%      <- base winding already correct
  cull=2  agree  1.8%      <- reversal applied here, wrongly
  cull=3  agree  0.7%      <- reversal belongs here
```

The per-flag split is what identified the bug: `cull=1` was already right, so
the base winding was fine and only the *reversal condition* was misplaced. That
matches the flag semantics — mode 2 is "clock", mode 3 is "**r**clock", i.e.
reversed clockwise. The reversal was keyed on 2 instead of 3.

Triangle lists needed separate treatment. `cull==2` and "always reverse" both
scored 100% at first because the initial sample contained only `cull=2`
triangle lists. Widening to the whole corpus found 279 `cull=1` triangle lists,
which disambiguated cleanly:

```
TRIANGLE LISTS, agreement by base winding
  cull=1 base=(a,b,c)    0.0%      cull=1 base=(b,a,c)  100.0%
  cull=2 base=(a,b,c)    0.0%      cull=2 base=(b,a,c)  100.0%
```

So both primitive types share one base winding (first two indices swapped) and
both reverse on `culling == 3`.

> Worth noting the near-miss: had I stopped at the first sample I would have
> "confirmed" a rule that only held because the sample was homogeneous. Check
> the distribution of the discriminating variable before trusting a 100%.

No `cull==3` triangle lists exist anywhere in the game, so that combination is
inferred from strip behaviour, not measured. Flagged in `nl1.md`.

### Exports

Both stages re-exported and re-verified:

```
stage1: 13 segments, 99,580 verts, 69,223 tris, 784 textures  -> CHECK-OK
stage2: 18 segments, 141,802 verts, 97,799 tris, 947 textures -> CHECK-OK
```

Stage 1 spans 7200 x 8198 x 2024 units, stage 2 spans 6698 x 3516 x 812 — both
already laid out in world space.

## Session 7 — texture alpha

**Reported:** `stage1` texture 46 should have transparency but did not.

**Confirmed.** The texture decode was already correct; the bug was in the
**material**.

### Diagnosis

`tex_046` is a different texture in every bank, which briefly muddied things:

| bank | tex 46 | list | IgnoreTexAlpha |
|---|---|---|---|
| `st1_01` | 64×64 RGB565 VQ | 0 | 1 |
| `st1_01c` | 128×64 RGB565 | 0 | 1 |
| `st1_02` | 64×256 RGB565 | 0 | 1 |
| **`st1_05`** | **64×128 ARGB4444** | **2** | **0** |

Only `st1_05` is meant to be transparent; the RGB565 ones have no alpha bits
and are genuinely opaque.

Its alpha *was* decoding correctly — 16 distinct values, soft gradient, 96.2%
opaque with an anti-aliased edge — and *was* present in the PNG (colour type 6,
RGBA). But the material said `alphaMode: OPAQUE`, so Blender ignored it.

### Cause

`alphaMode` was gated on the TSP **UseAlpha** bit (bit 20). That bit governs
whether the *vertex / base colour* alpha participates. It does not decide
whether blending happens — the **list type** does.

Requiring it marked **8,554** translucent meshes as opaque: most of the game's
glass, foliage and smoke. `alphaMode` now derives from the list type alone.

### Second problem, found while fixing the first

The corpus survey turned up **2,126 ARGB4444 meshes on the opaque list with
IgnoreTexAlpha set**, plus 1,698 ARGB1555. These textures carry real alpha that
the hardware discards. Emitting it would punch holes in solid geometry — the
mirror image of the reported bug, and one that would have been much harder to
attribute.

The exporter now writes a separate fully-opaque variant (`tex_NNN_opaque.png`)
when `IgnoreTexAlpha` is set, keying the texture cache on
`(part, texture_id, strip_alpha)` so a texture used both ways produces both. In
stage 1 that is 576 of 822 images.

### Also learned

- **Punch-through (list 4) never occurs anywhere.** No alpha testing in this
  game; cutouts use ordinary blending.
- **Additive blending (`src_alpha`/`one`) is real** — 2,704 meshes — but
  entirely confined to `eff_*` and boss assets. Stage geometry has none, which
  is why stages 1 and 2 report `additive=0`. glTF has no additive mode, so it
  exports as `BLEND` with `extras.pvr2.additive` set.
- The opaque list is perfectly uniform: `one`/`zero` + `IgnoreTexAlpha`, always.

Written up in [`../formats/materials.md`](../formats/materials.md).

### Result

```
stage1: 1520 materials -> 1125 OPAQUE, 395 BLEND, 822 images (576 opaque variants)
stage2: 1811 materials -> 1607 OPAQUE, 204 BLEND, 972 images (816 opaque variants)
both CHECK-OK
```

## Session 8 — baked lighting was being discarded

**Reported:** a face looked stretched, and separately looked black.

**Stretch: not a bug.** Measured texel density on the reported face
(`st2_03_model_002`, `st2_03_tex8_lambert`): u 6.94/unit, v 5.63/unit, ratio
**1.23 — uniform**. The texture is 128x128 square and decodes cleanly. Whatever
looked stretched there is authored tiling, not an export fault.

Getting to that took a script fix: `blender_whatsthis.py` was reading
`mesh.uv_layers` after re-entering Edit Mode, where the data is stale, so every
report silently omitted its UV section. Now reads in Object Mode and also
reports world-space face area and per-axis texel density — the metric that
actually distinguishes a stretched face from a legitimately tiled one.

### The real bug

The per-mesh **base colour** at mesh header `+0x2C` is the game's baked static
lighting, and the exporter was throwing it away.

`tsp_instruction` bits 6-7 select texture shading: **5,971 of 6,085** stage
meshes use **modulate**, i.e. `final = texture x base_colour`. And **32.2%** of
meshes carry a base colour below 0.95 — 281 at 0.50, 279 at 0.20, 117 at 0.10,
**80 at 0.00**.

The exporter forced `baseColorFactor` to white whenever a texture was present,
reasoning that the texture already supplied the colour and the base would
double-modulate. That reasoning was wrong: modulate *is* a multiply, and glTF's
`baseColorTexture x baseColorFactor` matches it exactly. The result was every
surface rendering at full brightness with all baked shading flattened out.

Now preserved, except under **decal** (3 meshes) where the texture genuinely
replaces the colour and white is correct.

```
stage2 baseColorFactor: 1437 white, 318 mid, 56 below 0.2
```

### Ruled out along the way

Chasing the stretch report eliminated a lot, all recorded so they are not
re-checked:

- non-square textures decode as well as square (coherence 0.294 vs 0.270/0.315)
- zero env-mapped strips in stage geometry
- clamp/flip axis mapping is correct (`clamp==1` has V fitting one tile 83% of
  the time vs U at 32%; `clamp==2` inverts)
- strip parsing is clean: 26,170 back-references, zero failures, zero abandoned
- degenerate triangles are only 0.35% of stage1+2 geometry
- per-triangle texel anisotropy: median 1.76, p90 5.68 (extremes are the
  degenerates)

One open item remains: **60 meshes have a clamped axis with a UV span beyond
one tile**, which smears by construction. The game clamps them too, so this may
be authentic rather than an export fault; resolving it needs the PowerVR clamp
semantics from the binary rather than inference.

---

## Session 9 — collapsed-UV triangles: the stretched/black faces

**Reported:** faces looking very stretched and very dark, persisting across a
clean re-import.

**Found and fixed.** 5.1% of triangles have real 3D area but **near-zero UV
area** — all three vertices collinear in UV space, so one row or column of
texels is smeared across the face's whole 2D extent.

### Evidence

```
mesh 0x12818  3D area 1079.1   uv v = 0.0000 on all three vertices, u 10.0 -> 0.0
mesh 0x19b68  3D area   39.3   uv u = 4.9186 on all three vertices, v varies
```

One UV axis pinned to a constant. That produces a hard directional streak, and a
solid-looking face when the sampled texels are uniform — which is exactly why
the affected faces rendered identically under `--uv-check` (solid grey rather
than a checkerboard).

Distribution across stage1+2: **8,500 of 166,440** triangles (5.1%), worst in
`st1_03` (1,250) and `st2_07` (1,197).

Position within the strip is the diagnostic:

```
first triangle   bad 4.9%
middle           bad 1.1%
last             bad 4.8%
```

**~4.5x concentration at strip boundaries** — the signature of stitching
artifacts. Only 8.6% involve a back-reference, so vertex reuse is not the cause.

Now dropped at export (`--keep-collapsed-uv` to retain). stage1 loses 3,615
triangles (5.5%), stage2 loses 5,452 (5.9%).

### Wrong turns, recorded so they are not repeated

This took far longer than it should have. Hypotheses pursued and disproved:

| Hypothesis | Disproved by |
|---|---|
| non-square texture decode | coherence 0.294 vs 0.270/0.315 for square |
| env-mapped UVs | zero env-mapped strips in stage geometry |
| clamp/flip axis swap | `clamp==1` has V fitting one tile 83% vs U 32% |
| back-reference resolution | 26,170 back-refs, zero failures |
| VQ sizing in that bank | offsets consistent at 6144 per 128x128 entry |
| base colour over-darkening | the face's mesh has base 1.00 |
| texture decoding dark | near-black textures are 36/972, spread across all formats |
| **duplicate imports z-fighting** | **user re-imported clean; identical result** |

The duplicate-import call was the worst of these: I read `.002`/`.003` object
suffixes in a screenshot as proof and asserted it confidently instead of
treating it as one candidate among several. The user had already been deleting
old imports. **A suffix is evidence of a name collision, not proof of its
cause.**

What actually solved it was giving up on aggregate statistics and dumping the
raw vertex data of specific bad triangles. The corpus-level metrics all looked
healthy — median anisotropy 1.76, 0.35% degenerate 3D triangles, uniform texel
density on the sampled faces — because a 5% tail does not move a median. The
per-face reports the user sent were also clean, because the faces they happened
to sample were not the collapsed ones.

**Lesson: when aggregate health contradicts a consistent visual report, stop
computing aggregates and print the raw records of the outliers.**

### Still unresolved

Why the game does not display these. Either the hardware rejects polygons with
zero UV area, or they are hidden along the camera rail. Worth settling from the
binary rather than inferring, but dropping them is safe regardless — they carry
no displayable texture information.

Also still open: 60 meshes with a clamped axis and a UV span beyond one tile.

---

## Session 10 — stretched faces: what was proved, and what is still open

**Reported:** faces look very stretched. Persists after the collapsed-UV fix,
after a clean re-import, and — critically — **under `--uv-check` as well**, which
rules out texture content entirely.

**Not solved.** Two real bugs were found and fixed along the way, but neither
fully explains the report. This entry records the evidence so the next session
does not re-tread it.

### Ground truth: my UVs match the reference implementation exactly

The cross-check planned back in Phase 3 and repeatedly deferred. Extracted
`st2_07` model 12 to a standalone NL1 file and ran the reference
`NLimporter.parse_nl()` inside Blender:

```
reference : (2.0000, -1.0000) (0.0000, -1.0000) (1.8434, -0.0000) (0.1566, -0.0000)
hod2lib   : (2.000,  -1.000)  (0.000,  -1.000)  (1.843,  -0.000)  (0.157,  -0.000)
```

Identical. **UV parsing is correct**, and the reference addon would render the
same apparent stretching. To re-run:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/nlpkg && ln -sfn ~/blender-NaomiLib /tmp/nlpkg/naomilib
# then inside Blender: sys.path.insert(0,"/tmp/nlpkg"); from naomilib.NLimporter import parse_nl
```

### No systematic u/v bias

For every triangle, world-units-per-texel along u versus along v, via the
texel→world Jacobian:

```
geometric mean 0.937      median 0.955      n = 72,209

  <0.55     24.2%
  0.55-0.9  22.9%
  ~1.0      14.6%
  1.1-1.8   16.6%
  ~2.0       6.1%
  >2.2      15.6%
```

Centred on 1.0 and **symmetric in both directions**. A global aspect error — a
factor of 2 somewhere, u/v transposed, VQ half-size mishandled — would skew this
distribution hard to one side. It does not. Competing hypotheses scored worse on
median anisotropy: as-is 1.81, VQ-half-dims 1.81, square-1:1 2.15, u/v-swapped
2.50.

So the anisotropy is **in the source data**, spread symmetrically, i.e. it looks
authored.

### Ruled out this session

| Hypothesis | Disproved by |
|---|---|
| UV parsing wrong | matches reference `parse_nl()` byte for byte |
| u/v transposed | median anisotropy worsens 1.81 → 2.50 |
| VQ half-size affects UVs | identical result to as-is |
| systematic aspect factor | geometric mean 0.937, symmetric spread |
| duplicate geometry in one export | 14/14, 3/3, 3/3 models distinct by vertex hash |
| texture content streaking | `--uv-check` is stretched too |
| vertex stride wrong | 100% of sampled normals unit length |

### Two real bugs found and fixed

1. **Collapsed-UV triangles** (previous entry) — 5.1% of triangles have real 3D
   area but ~zero UV area, concentrated 4.5x at strip boundaries. Now dropped.
2. **Base colour discarded** — 32% of meshes carry baked lighting below 0.95.
   Now applied under `modulate`.

Neither accounts for widespread stretching.

### The live lead: 16-bit UVs are never decoded

`parameter_control` bit 0 selects **16-bit UV** instead of two `f32`. Across
stage1+2:

```
32-bit UV : 5,957 meshes
16-bit UV :   128 meshes   (2.1%)
```

Worst files: `st2_02` (13), `st1_03b` (12), `st2_07` (11), `st1_1` (10),
`st2_03` (9).

**Neither `hod2lib` nor the reference addon honours this flag** — both always
read two 32-bit floats. For those 128 meshes the vertex stride and the UV values
are therefore both wrong, which would produce exactly this kind of garbage
mapping.

Caveat, stated plainly: **2.1% of meshes cannot explain stretching seen across
many surfaces.** This is worth fixing because it is definitely wrong, but it
should not be presented as the answer until it is measured. `st2_07` — the file
the reported face lives in — is third worst, so check whether the reported mesh
is one of the 128 before assuming.

### Next steps

1. Determine the 16-bit UV vertex layout from `Hod2.exe` rather than guessing.
   The renderer must branch on PCW bit 0 somewhere near the vertex submission
   path. Fix `_read_vertex` and re-measure anisotropy on the affected meshes.
2. Check whether the specific reported faces are among those 128 meshes.
3. If they are not, the remaining explanation is that the anisotropy is genuine
   and the game hides it behind its fixed camera rail — which would make `cam/`
   and `evt/` (Phase 6) the way to confirm, by reconstructing the intended view.

### Process note

This took far too long. The pattern of failure was consistent: corpus-wide
statistics kept coming back healthy because the artefacts sit in a small tail
that does not move a median, and the two per-face reports supplied happened to
sample clean faces. Progress only came from dumping raw records for specific bad
triangles, and from finally running the reference implementation instead of
reasoning about whether it would agree.

Worse, I asserted a wrong root cause (duplicate imports z-fighting) from a
`.002` suffix in a screenshot. It was a plausible candidate; it was not proof,
and I stated it as though it were. **Offer candidates as candidates until a
measurement settles them.**
