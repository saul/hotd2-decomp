/**
 * The schema digest this client was compiled against. **Generated file.**
 *
 * Written by `web/tools/gen/schema_hash.ts` (`npm run gen:hashes`) and
 * committed; re-run it after changing any declaration in this directory.
 * `web/tools/repo/exporters.ts` fails when this file is stale, so it cannot
 * quietly drift from its sources.
 *
 * The exporter imports {@link SCHEMA_HASH} and stamps it into
 * `manifest.json`, and `bundle/load.ts` refuses a bundle whose digest is not
 * this one -- so the exporter and the client agree by construction rather than
 * by anyone remembering.
 *
 * The digest covers the *declarations* in `web/src/bundle/*.ts` -- comments
 * and whitespace are stripped before hashing -- so editing a doc comment costs
 * nothing and changing a field invalidates every bundle built before it. See
 * `docs/formats/bundle.md`.
